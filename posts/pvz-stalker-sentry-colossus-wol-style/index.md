# Perfi's notes on Probe's guide, based on the video

Reasoning behind this build popping up now:

* Banes got nerfed vs stalkers
* Oracles got buffed vs creep
* Shield battery helps with defense

<!--TEASER_END-->

## Opening

* Try to open gas first, either don't scout (greedy) or put 15/16 probes on minerals, 2 on gas initially.
* Besides that it's the standard PvZ stargate opening.
* Adept, then Stalker.
    * If 2 zerglings are chasing your probe, assume 2 were sent across -> CB the 2nd gate unit, maybe leave adept home
    * otherwise feel free to CB probes.
* Oracle gateway pylon, order does not matter
    * however, always start the pylon with the first stargate unit or you'll get supply blocked.
* Variation:
    * either skip CB on the oracle to get earlier 3:30 natural gasses and 6 sentries early,
    * or get them 3:45-4:00 and get earlier oracle, but only 4 sentries early.
* Definitely chronoboost the second oracle.
* Before first oracle reaches the enemy base, send probe for 3rd ~ 3:55.
    * greedy variant gets nexus down at like 4:10, before wg warpin
    * safe variant gets 2 adepts first right as wg finishes and moves them with probe to the third.

## After the 3rd is started

* after the adepts: straight sentries, 4 or 6 depending on the earlier variant.
* At ~4:48 add TC, forge, at least you want them started by 5 minutes.
* Make a **slight** probe cut to get 4 more gateways up faster. Probe likes to go to 20 probes in minerals at the natural. You still want to probe up for your 3rd to be saturated quickly.
    * **Note**: [*I asked Probe in the comments about this. His exact words were:* " Yeah you want to cut probes to get the gateways earlier, but still want to be a bit economic. I have just found 20 to be a nice amount for me to get everything in time."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIc4oFVLjA4&lc=Ugw8oO8223jsJsc2wCh4AaABAg)
* start blink, +1 weapons

## Decision point - do we apply pressure?

* Is there a 4th? scout with oracles + halluc
* if so, build a lot of stalkers, a proxy pylon (no prism) to reinforce (placement: to threaten 4th), try to get a cancel - if not we at least forced out units.
    * the moveout uses forcefields + recall to retreat if necessary
* if there is no 4th, we stay defensive

## Transition to Robo

Regardless, start robo by 6:30, even if pushing out

* we don't get any early obs - instead we use the 25mana revelation to clear creep - KEEP ORACLES ALIVE 

Two ways you can play this vs standard Ling-Bane-Ravager:
* either go to 2 robo colossus: 1 robo, then bay + 2nd robo
* or 1 robo colossus, add charge + archives -> archons


* if he stays on 3bases, don't be afraid to invest a lot in shield batteries and cannons - his army is likely going to be worse than yours.
* Against LBRavager, you want to have 8-10 sentries for infinite ($\oo \approx 40$) forcefields
* Get very aggressive at max supply.

## Other notes

* you can HEAR the direction nyduses pop out from on stereo headphones!

* Prioritize weapons upgrades.
