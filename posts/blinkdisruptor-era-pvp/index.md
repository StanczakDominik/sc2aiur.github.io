My notes throughout. Note: as of writing down these, this matchup is not yet
figured out, so things are controversial. Everyone's got their own approach.
Take none of this as a given.

This writeup covers:

* HolyHit's general blink/disruptor analysis
* Probe's 4 sentry blink stalker opening into 8gate warp prism timing attack

# HolyHit's Blink/Disruptor analysis

* The goal with blink stalkers is to get free damage; try not to trade, because
    you want to amass enough stalkers to 1shot phoenixes. Exception:
    stalker-stalker wars, then good trades are necessary.
* Shield battery is your friend. Cannons are sort of useless.
* Stalker/sentry is a bad opener because it lets the enemy know you're
  macroing, so they can greed hard.
* Minimize the amount of gateway units that aren't stalkers. 2 intial adepts?
    Skip them.
* Positioning is very important.

## The opener

* on Pillars of Gold, because of the natural ramp, 1gate expand is powerful;
    consider gate scouting to pylon block the opponent's nexus if necessary.
* 2 adepts into 4 sentries
    * 4 sentries can actually beat 2 adepts!
    * also pretty helpful for halluc
    * Also, plenty more minerals -> shield battery at each base is easier to
        fit in
* Nexus ~after first 2 sentries, then TC as first tech building, ASAP, before 2
    stalkers
* Probe production is very important; overbuild probes on a single base to
    transfer them to the second faster.
* Usually (not in this game, delayed by stalkers vs the oracles), forge asap
    after blink starts
* As many stalkers as you can warp in off 2 gate; first stalker moveout is
    towards the 3rd base as blink is finishing.
    * Third base behind it, on 3 gas.
    * move out with 4 stalkers, 4 sentries, usually.
    * Look for free damage. Don't commit; it's just light pressure.
* Robo, and 2 more gateways. Order (3rd/robo/2 gates) is flexible.

## The timing attack

* Don't overbuild probes when going to 3 base. Stop at ~47. The 3rd is mostly a
    mindgame/backup plan. You'll have just a few probes to saturate the 3rd
    with.
* Go to 8gate, get chronoboosted charge, get a warp prism.
* Always prioritize stalkers for warp ins. Zealots really suck in stalkers
    wars.
* Attack by ~8:20, 12 stalkers, 4 sentries, warp prism. Bank 800 minerals for a
    zealot warp in.
* On some maps, if unscouted, blink/prism into main, then warp in zealots and
    forcefield off.
    * If scouted, or the map doesn't work, you can often still win.
    * Put the prism in the back, don't lose it.
    * Unpower as many gateways as possible as a priority.
